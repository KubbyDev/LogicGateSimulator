This computer was not made for performance so its circuits are not optimal, it's more like a way to show the possibilities of the simulator.

Timings:
IN signals are applied on the rising edge of the clock
OUT signals are applied when the signal is on
The control logic (and so the signals) are updated on the falling edge of the clock
